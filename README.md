##Hi there! ðŸ‘‹##
My name is __@KatShulu__ and I am a passionate learner currently enrolled in a __2-year formation program__ with Ada tech school. My interests lie in the realm of __back-end development__, and I am excited to explore the possibility of __mobile development__ in the future.

I am currently learning various programming languages such as:

*HTML
*CSS
*JavaScript
*Python
*C
*PHP
*SQL

I am eager to collaborate with others who share the same love for coding and are looking to __expand their knowledge__. I am always on the lookout for __new learning opportunities and challenges__ to help me grow as a developer.

When I am not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies or indulging in some __gaming fun__. Let's connect and have fun with code! ðŸ˜„
